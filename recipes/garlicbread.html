      “Sounds difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually quite
      easy. This bread dresses up Italian meals, and it disappears fast! Make
      two loaves for company!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="header">ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf italian bread or 1 loaf french bread, unsliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter or margarine</li>
      <l1>2 garlic clove, smashed</l1>
      <li>3 tablespoons parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon basil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="header">steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice loaf, LEAVING CRUST INTACT, into slices. It is important NOT to
        slice through the bottom. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Mix butter with other ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Take a length of foil, and place loaf lengthwise on the foil. Very
        gently, spread slices apart, being careful not to break bottom, and
        spread with butter mixture. When all slices are spread, use any leftover
        butter to spread the top of the loaf.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap sides of foil up. Leave top UNCOVERED. Twist ends of foil.</li>
      <li>Bake on tray for about 20-30 minutes in a 350 degree oven.</li>
    </ol>
