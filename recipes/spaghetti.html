      “I looked everywhere for an easy baked spaghetti that did NOT use
      mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup (husband is allergic). I am happy to
      say I found it. You could add mushrooms, green pepper, olives, etc. to
      this dish for added variety, but I like it just the way it is! This makes
      a great family meal...just add a tossed salad and some garlic bread, and
      dinner is ready in about an hour.”
