Hello,
In this project I will be creating a basic recipe website with a brutalist design. At the end of the project I will write a brief summary of the skills that I used when creating the website.

Summary:
While making this simple website, I tested my ability to make ordered/unordered lists, basic HTML page setup, as well as properly using relative links.

As this is a project I am performing as a part of my cirriculum with The Odin Project, I have cited my sources for page content below.
